They explain that such questions are designed to assess a candidate's knowledge, skills, and abilities required for success. They provide examples of behavioral questions, such as working effectively under pressure, implementing an unpopular decision, and working effectively with a team. They introduce the STAR method, which is a framework for answering behavioral-based interview questions by describing a specific situation, task, action, and result of past experiences. The video emphasizes the importance of tailoring the success story to the specific job and company. The video includes several visual captions of two men driving in a car, sitting in chairs, and standing in front of a whiteboard, along with screenshots of star descriptions on a screen. The main idea of the video is to provide job seekers with a specific way to answer behavioral interview questions using the STAR method and tailoring the success story to the job and company..
