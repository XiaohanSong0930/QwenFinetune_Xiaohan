Wanna be the Official helper, boy? Yeah you do! You gonna test these beauty products out? You gonna see? Just kidding, we do not do animal testing. We do not support animal testing. Hey, what's up everybody, it is Nicole Skyes and welcome back to another episode of Is it a beauty hack, or is it whack? Where I test out popular Beauty hacks and see if they actually work or if they're just totally whack. So today we are going to be testing out if the DIY sugar hard wax mixture combination and the waxing actually works. If it actually removes my hair. And we actually also are going to be having another besides my dog of course. Um, my fiancee, Jay is actually going to be waxing part of his arm hair too see if this actually works or not. So what we need to use to make this DIY sugar wax is half a cup of lemon juice, half a cup of water and two cups of sugar. You also are going to need a jar and I didn't really have any jars so I used an old pickle jar and it happens to say bubbles on it. So after you have boiled your mixture for about five to seven minutes you wanna pour it into your jar. Now if you are using glass, make sure that the glass is not cold by any chance because pouring hot liquid into it could burst the glass, and you do not want that. So after you let it cool down because you have to let it cool down I made this mistake if you watch this here I poured it when the bubbles were still bubbling and it made a huge mess so I had to wait so I poured it in the jar and you're supposed to wait like I didn't think I would take this long this is still really hot and I think I'm going to have to pour this into a smaller bowl because it's still really hot but it smells good, and I tried a little bit of it and it's really good. So yeah, I'm going to pour this into a dish, then I am going to let it cool down, so it cools down faster because it is taking way too long. Okay, hey you guys, here is my fiancee Jay, and we are going to be doing a test on his arm too see if this waxing actually works or not and he has reluctantly agreed to do this he really does not want to but he is a good sport. He's a good guy so he is going to try it out I put just a tiny bit on his hand.\nSpeaker 2: Oooh, failure. It didn't even do anything\nSpeaker 1: okay, well we got a couple hairs actually we need to try this again. So this is not hard waxing, this is um, soft waxing. 3.. 2.. 1... Ohhhh ohh cocky we got some hairs especially like right here. Let's see your hand, aw your poor hand is red, aw see, so it didn't totally get everything out it did, it kinda work for his hand a little bit. It made his hand red. And like did that hurt?\nSpeaker 2: No, it didn't hurt at all.\nSpeaker 1: So, do you think this is a hack, or totally whack?\nSpeaker 2: Totally whack. Totally whack.. **End of transcript** Combine images and transcript, answer this question: What can be deduced about societal norms regarding the inclusion of personal relationships in content creation based on Nicole's interaction with her fiancé?.

Hey, what's up everybody, it is Nicole Skyes and welcome back to another episode of Is it a beauty hack, or is it whack? Where I test out popular Beauty hacks and see if they actually work or if they're just totally whack. So today we are going to be testing out if the DIY sugar hard wax mixture combination and the waxing actually works. If it actually removes my hair. And we actually also are going to be having another besides my dog of course. Um, my fiancee, Jay is actually going to be waxing part of his arm hair too see if this actually works or not. So what we need to use to make this DIY sugar wax is half a cup of lemon juice, half a cup of water and two cups of sugar. You also are going to need a jar and I didn't really have any jars so I used an old pickle jar and it happens to say bubbles on it. So after you have boiled your mixture for about five to seven minutes you wanna pour it into your jar. Now if you are using glass, make sure that the glass is not cold by any chance because pouring hot liquid into it could burst the glass, and you do not want that. So after you let it cool down because you have to let it cool down I made this mistake if you watch this here I poured it when the bubbles were still bubbling and it made a huge mess so I had to wait so I poured it in the jar and you're supposed to wait like I didn't think I would take this long this is still really hot and I think I'm going to have to pour this into a smaller bowl because it's still really hot but it smells good, and I tried a little bit of it and it's really good. So yeah, I'm going to pour this into a dish, then I am going to let it cool down, so it cools down faster because it is taking way too long. Okay, hey you guys, here is my fiancee Jay, and we are going to be doing a test on his arm too see if this waxing actually works or not and he has reluctantly agreed to do this he really does not want to but he is a good sport. He's a good guy so he is going to try it out I put just a tiny bit on his hand.\nSpeaker 2: Oooh, failure. It didn't even do anything\nSpeaker 1: okay, well we got a couple hairs actually we need to try this again. So this is not hard waxing, this is um, soft waxing. 3.. 2.. 1... Ohhhh ohh cocky we got some hairs especially like right here. Let's see your hand, aw your poor hand is red, aw see, so it didn't totally get everything out it did, it kinda work for his hand a little bit. It made his hand red. And like did that hurt?\nSpeaker 2: No, it didn't hurt at all.\nSpeaker 1: So, do you think this is a hack, or totally whack?\nSpeaker 2: Totally whack.

But one person, one person out there is standing by him, his wife, and strategic eye shadow reserve, Melania Trump. Yesterday, Melania did interviews for both Fox News and CNN. She would have gone on MSNBC, but Steve Kornacki gets jealous when another supermodel is on the network. The man is an Adonis. Now, last night, on the Anderson Cooper Power Hour, Melania explained who she really blames, for Donald Trump's behavior.

Consider alternative approaches that could better resolve the issue.. Options: A) By shifting the blame onto Billy Bush, she diverts attention from Trump's accountability, potentially undermining public trust in genuine apologies. A better approach would be for Melania to acknowledge the inappropriate behavior and emphasize the importance of personal accountability.\nB) By attributing Trump's behavior to peer pressure, she downplays the seriousness of the comments, which could lead to a lack of meaningful dialogue about respect and decency. A more effective method would be for her to recognize the seriousness of the comments and discuss steps Trump is taking to improve his behavior.\nC) By presenting the remarks as mere 'boy talk', she risks normalizing inappropriate behavior, making it harder to address and prevent such actions in the future. Instead, she could condemn the remarks and advocate for respectful and appropriate language in all settings.\nD) By defending Trump's actions as influenced by others, she creates a narrative that excuses personal responsibility, complicating efforts to foster a culture of accountability and respect. She could promote a culture of accountability by encouraging Trump to take full responsibility and publicly commit to better behavior in the future.. Answer with a letter A or B or C or D."

Options: A) Encourage them to have separate roles in the firm - By defining clear and distinct roles for s1 and s2, they can avoid overlapping responsibilities and reduce the likelihood of future conflicts. This approach ensures that each has autonomy in their respective areas, leading to less friction and more efficient collaboration.\nB) Suggest a focus on a common goal - Guiding s1 and s2 to concentrate on a shared objective, such as increasing the firm's overall impact, can help them put aside their differences. Working together towards a unified vision can foster cooperation and mutual respect, as they will see the benefits of their combined efforts.\nC) Implement regular communication meetings - Establishing a routine for regular, transparent meetings can address the root cause of their conflict. These meetings would allow both s1 and s2 to share updates, strategies, and concerns, ensuring that both are always informed and aligned, thus preventing misunderstandings.\nD) Propose external mediation - Bringing in a neutral third-party mediator to facilitate discussions between s1 and s2 can help them navigate their disagreements. A mediator can provide unbiased insights and guide them towards a mutually acceptable resolution, helping to rebuild trust and improve their working relationship..

Transcript: Speaker 1: I got you boys! KILT from Scotland!\nSpeaker 2: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nSpeaker 2: Good morning everyone! Hello! Hello! Hi! What's on your ears? Are those beautiful ears? Yeah!\nSpeaker 3: I have a baby!\nSpeaker 1: What's your ears? Are those really? Yeah, really! Oh my goodness! I just got my ears pierced! Oh my goodness! I just got my ears pierced! Oh my goodness!\nSpeaker 2: I just got my ears pierced! Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness!\nSpeaker 1: That's my first one in your first stone!\nSpeaker 2: Oh my gosh, you look beautiful! What's this? Our lunch! That looks fairly surprising Colleen with her new earrings! The bad news is, I bought two presents for you guys in Europe and one got lost in the luggage. So one of them is still in Europe somewhere. And I'm going to tell you what it is. So when I was in Amsterdam, it was a really cool city.\nSpeaker 2: It's like my favorite city. Your mommy and daddy went there on their honeymoon.\nSpeaker 1: I found a store that had weird, cool, crazy looking fidget spinners. And I bought you each one. Oh my gosh! But they're still in whales. So those will get shipped here. They probably won't come for like a month or something. But the good news is that when you get them, you will have forgotten about them. So it'll be like a surprise. But I did have something else for you. But no, the bottom's coming too. Okay. Oh, here it comes.\nSpeaker 4: It's a bunch of different places.\nSpeaker 2: I went to Amsterdam.\nSpeaker 1: I went to Scotland. I went to Wales.\nSpeaker 2: I went to Sweden. I went all over the place. So I got you guys stuff in different places.\nSpeaker 4: But I got this for Dunky. It's a little Scottish dog.\nSpeaker 1: It's a little Scottish dog. I think I've been having fun. Love stuffed animals. Love stuffed animals. And I got that doggy because it has the same material as something I got for the boys.\nSpeaker 2: So do you know what they wear in Scotland? The boys?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Why they wear in Scotland? They wear kilts. And so I got you boys. Kilts from Scotland! ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I was waiting for a kilt!\nSpeaker 2: They're back in the kilt.\nSpeaker 1: And they didn't have that piece of it. It's like you didn't like that. It's screaming very much. So it's like, you know what? It's like that screaming very much. It's like that screaming very much. It's like, you got the matching doggy print. So I don't know if they're going to fit you. They look really small to me. But here, let's make sure this fits here. Now as far as I know, kilts they represent families in Scotland. So people would wear them to represent their clan. I watch Outlander lots.\nSpeaker 2: I feel like I know things about Scotland.\nSpeaker 1: But I'm sure I have a lot to learn.\nSpeaker 2: And I would love to share the history of kilts with the children. If you happen to know it and feel like sharing it with us.\nSpeaker 1: Wow, Jacob, you look amazing. Parker, oh my goodness. This is what I've been waiting for. It's awesome on you. It's awesome on you.\nSpeaker 3: It's awesome on you. It's awesome on you. Yeah, so these, I think these go down here.\nSpeaker 2: So it doesn't fly open. Parker's been wanting a kilt for years. Like he's been wanting one for a very long time. And whenever I find them online, they're like hundreds of dollars. So, yeah. I think in Scotland, and they were much more reasonably priced. Oh, I have something else, Parker. That might complete the outfit if you want it.\nSpeaker 1: That might complete the outfit if you want it. If you don't want this, this is okay. So I bought something when I was in Scotland. Because my hair was really curly and big. And I needed something to put down. Because the wind was blowing into my face. So I got a traditional Scottish hat.\nSpeaker 2: That looks awesome.\nSpeaker 1: I'll show Mommy. So it's so cool. One cool thing about Edinburgh, which is my favorite city. Like, probably in the world. It's in the middle of the city. It's a huge castle. Like a huge, beautiful castle. At the top of the city. So we went there. And what we got to see, which I've never seen before in my whole life, was the real crown that the princess and the queen wear from like, for hundreds and hundreds of years. We saw the actual... Yeah, Mary Queen of Scots, like actual crown and scepter. And so I bought you a princess crown at the castle. With diamonds all over it. With beautiful. Isn't that pretty? Isn't that beautiful? So that's a real crown from Scotland. That's beautiful. It matches perfect. Oh, wow. And you guys have fidget spinners coming soon too.\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. Love you guys.\nSpeaker 1: Love you. I tried to get a kilt for a donkey too, but they didn't have them in his size. But you know, it's cool parkers when you go out of this one, and it seems like it's going to be soon. Maybe Jake will share his with you too, because it's the next size up. And you can do it. You are stuck again. We are home from Queens now. Most of the kids are having bad, except for this guy.\nSpeaker 2: We're going to do that or going to Seoul.\nSpeaker 1: He's our superstar of the week, and earned a bunch of good credits from good behavior. And so he gets to stay up an hour later than the other kids. Go Jacob, proud of you buddy.\nSpeaker 3: And what a night to get to stay up late, is we have Kazan Andrew.\nSpeaker 2: And then this guy, deep in thought, and we have our dear Rachel here. Moscow, gone heat.\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what's going on. So. And me.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm still Rachel. It's funny you should say you don't know what's going on, Rachel, because clearly we are playing the epic game of pandemic.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, so we're about to save the world.\nSpeaker 2: I'm really sorry, world. It didn't end well for you. Because of this guy.\nSpeaker 6: Because of you guys were on your phones all the time.\nSpeaker 3: You didn't even look at the time.\nSpeaker 2: Excuse us.\nSpeaker 3: We came up with a better strategy, and they didn't go with it, and that's why the world was so great. I was like, say New York, say New York, and they're like, whatever. You did hear us say it, Andrew. Because we moved your piece to right nice in New York. And then Christopher was like, did you see New York and go save Africa? And we were like, what? I have no idea.\nSpeaker 1: No.\nSpeaker 6: We saved Sydney, Australia.\nSpeaker 4: You're welcome, Sydney, Australia.\nSpeaker 6: And guess what? How have we not done that? We would have lost sooner, because that would have over.\nSpeaker 2: Christopher is relying on nobody ever having played pandemic, because Sydney, Australia is actually next to nothing, and would not have saved anything. New York is like a hub to the world. I'm so embarrassed for him, because really, if you have any of you understand what we're talking about, and you will see what a hot mess he is in this discussion.\nSpeaker 1: Moving on to early America and the train system in...\nSpeaker 3: Take it to red.\nSpeaker 2: So now we're playing Take It to Red, and I'm just going to predict it right now that I'll win. Throwing that out there. How about that?\nSpeaker 3: You can put the internet in the play or hands, because it's your trip. Harry keeps wanting me to do my trip. You guys, this is really stressful. Our board is filling up, folks. Look at those trains.\nSpeaker 6: Look at those trains. Oh, yes.\nSpeaker 8: Oh, yes.\nSpeaker 9: Foodie, you think the fun ones are at this party?\nSpeaker 2: We need your boat down below. We'll pin the winner. Very, very tall. Oh, hello, Seattle. I forgot the rules, and so I didn't play my best abilities.\nSpeaker 1: I played to my best abilities. I'm playing with my...\nSpeaker 2: Because you want to remember the rules. So we'll see who wins, and I'm just saying, I don't know. Guess who won, guys.\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead and guess.\nSpeaker 3: I'm going to be some time.\nSpeaker 2: Who's free you want to talk to everybody?\nSpeaker 6: Well, I'm over here at 74, which was really sad, because I was slated to go much further, because I was slated to go much further, but I didn't make it to one of my cities, so... Right, show.\nSpeaker 9: When it was a big card, it was like a 20-something card.\nSpeaker 6: What are we talking about our total number? 105.\nSpeaker 9: 108.\nSpeaker 8: I had 132.\nSpeaker 2: I'm just saying, I can't figure out who won there or not, but I don't know. Maybe you guys want to answer that. Yeah, I didn't know we're changing. I will be back here next week with an actual strategy. Oh, rematch! The way to get a ratio back here is to be a jerk about winning.\nSpeaker 4: Is that how?\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, so be it.\nSpeaker 2: You fail to understand the competitive nature. I guess this is what sports is. I've been too nice to you.\nSpeaker 4: That's what it is.\nSpeaker 2: Now that I think about it, I thought the real Rachel was you wouldn't play any games with me when I was...\nSpeaker 3: No, kind of. Don't make me feel stupid, I don't want to play with you.\nSpeaker 2: Then you can feel stupid.\nSpeaker 3: Not at all.\nSpeaker 2: Just now, you're just being overly cocky about your abilities, but not diminishing minds.\nSpeaker 9: Therefore, competitive.\nSpeaker 2: I don't even know who won yet. I was so waiting for people to do the math. I know we were just going to tell you, Jess.\nSpeaker 3: Nobody's going to tell you.\nSpeaker 2: You've got to do the math on your own. I don't know, I can't figure out. I have to do it on calculations. I know, as I'm not the one cleaning out.\nSpeaker 3: Oh, my God!\nSpeaker 6: Don't worry. We've left all your red pieces out there.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, man, that's a lot of pieces though.\nSpeaker 6: Oh, man, that's a lot of pieces though. It's like a lot of pieces. A lot of successful, trained pieces on that board.\nSpeaker 6: Hi.\nSpeaker 4: Let's talk about what we learned today. We learned that you should never visit somebody's house empty handed.\nSpeaker 6: Always pack a lunch.\nSpeaker 4: We learned that Parker expresses his joy of a new killed by screaming loud enough for all of Scotland to hear him. And finally, we learned that if you want Rachel to come over more often,\nSpeaker 2: it's just got to be mean to her. Thanks for watching, everybody. See you next time.. **End of transcript** Combine images and transcript, answer this question: Why is s1 feeling sad?. Options: A) Because the presents they bought were not liked by others.

Transcript: Speaker 1: I got you boys! KILT from Scotland!\nSpeaker 2: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nSpeaker 2: Good morning everyone! Hello! Hello! Hi! What's on your ears? Are those beautiful ears? Yeah!\nSpeaker 3: I have a baby!\nSpeaker 1: What's your ears? Are those really? Yeah, really! Oh my goodness! I just got my ears pierced! Oh my goodness! I just got my ears pierced! Oh my goodness!\nSpeaker 2: I just got my ears pierced! Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness!\nSpeaker 1: That's my first one in your first stone!\nSpeaker 2: Oh my gosh, you look beautiful! What's this? Our lunch! That looks fairly surprising Colleen with her new earrings! The bad news is, I bought two presents for you guys in Europe and one got lost in the luggage. So one of them is still in Europe somewhere. And I'm going to tell you what it is. So when I was in Amsterdam, it was a really cool city.\nSpeaker 2: It's like my favorite city. Your mommy and daddy went there on their honeymoon.\nSpeaker 1: I found a store that had weird, cool, crazy looking fidget spinners. And I bought you each one. Oh my gosh! But they're still in whales. So those will get shipped here. They probably won't come for like a month or something. But the good news is that when you get them, you will have forgotten about them. So it'll be like a surprise. But I did have something else for you. But no, the bottom's coming too. Okay. Oh, here it comes.\nSpeaker 4: It's a bunch of different places.\nSpeaker 2: I went to Amsterdam.\nSpeaker 1: I went to Scotland. I went to Wales.\nSpeaker 2: I went to Sweden. I went all over the place. So I got you guys stuff in different places.\nSpeaker 4: But I got this for Dunky. It's a little Scottish dog.\nSpeaker 1: It's a little Scottish dog. I think I've been having fun. Love stuffed animals. Love stuffed animals. And I got that doggy because it has the same material as something I got for the boys.\nSpeaker 2: So do you know what they wear in Scotland? The boys?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Why they wear in Scotland? They wear kilts. And so I got you boys. Kilts from Scotland! ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I was waiting for a kilt!\nSpeaker 2: They're back in the kilt.\nSpeaker 1: And they didn't have that piece of it. It's like you didn't like that. It's screaming very much. So it's like, you know what? It's like that screaming very much. It's like that screaming very much. It's like, you got the matching doggy print. So I don't know if they're going to fit you. They look really small to me. But here, let's make sure this fits here. Now as far as I know, kilts they represent families in Scotland. So people would wear them to represent their clan. I watch Outlander lots.\nSpeaker 2: I feel like I know things about Scotland.\nSpeaker 1: But I'm sure I have a lot to learn.\nSpeaker 2: And I would love to share the history of kilts with the children. If you happen to know it and feel like sharing it with us.\nSpeaker 1: Wow, Jacob, you look amazing. Parker, oh my goodness. This is what I've been waiting for. It's awesome on you. It's awesome on you.\nSpeaker 3: It's awesome on you. It's awesome on you. Yeah, so these, I think these go down here.\nSpeaker 2: So it doesn't fly open. Parker's been wanting a kilt for years. Like he's been wanting one for a very long time. And whenever I find them online, they're like hundreds of dollars. So, yeah. I think in Scotland, and they were much more reasonably priced. Oh, I have something else, Parker. That might complete the outfit if you want it.\nSpeaker 1: That might complete the outfit if you want it. If you don't want this, this is okay. So I bought something when I was in Scotland. Because my hair was really curly and big. And I needed something to put down. Because the wind was blowing into my face. So I got a traditional Scottish hat.\nSpeaker 2: That looks awesome.\nSpeaker 1: I'll show Mommy. So it's so cool. One cool thing about Edinburgh, which is my favorite city. Like, probably in the world. It's in the middle of the city. It's a huge castle. Like a huge, beautiful castle. At the top of the city. So we went there. And what we got to see, which I've never seen before in my whole life, was the real crown that the princess and the queen wear from like, for hundreds and hundreds of years. We saw the actual... Yeah, Mary Queen of Scots, like actual crown and scepter. And so I bought you a princess crown at the castle. With diamonds all over it. With beautiful. Isn't that pretty? Isn't that beautiful? So that's a real crown from Scotland. That's beautiful. It matches perfect. Oh, wow. And you guys have fidget spinners coming soon too.\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. Love you guys.\nSpeaker 1: Love you. I tried to get a kilt for a donkey too, but they didn't have them in his size. But you know, it's cool parkers when you go out of this one, and it seems like it's going to be soon. Maybe Jake will share his with you too, because it's the next size up. And you can do it. You are stuck again. We are home from Queens now. Most of the kids are having bad, except for this guy.\nSpeaker 2: We're going to do that or going to Seoul.\nSpeaker 1: He's our superstar of the week, and earned a bunch of good credits from good behavior. And so he gets to stay up an hour later than the other kids. Go Jacob, proud of you buddy.\nSpeaker 3: And what a night to get to stay up late, is we have Kazan Andrew.\nSpeaker 2: And then this guy, deep in thought, and we have our dear Rachel here. Moscow, gone heat.\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what's going on. So. And me.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm still Rachel. It's funny you should say you don't know what's going on, Rachel, because clearly we are playing the epic game of pandemic.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, so we're about to save the world.\nSpeaker 2: I'm really sorry, world. It didn't end well for you. Because of this guy.\nSpeaker 6: Because of you guys were on your phones all the time.\nSpeaker 3: You didn't even look at the time.\nSpeaker 2: Excuse us.\nSpeaker 3: We came up with a better strategy, and they didn't go with it, and that's why the world was so great. I was like, say New York, say New York, and they're like, whatever. You did hear us say it, Andrew. Because we moved your piece to right nice in New York. And then Christopher was like, did you see New York and go save Africa? And we were like, what? I have no idea.\nSpeaker 1: No.\nSpeaker 6: We saved Sydney, Australia.\nSpeaker 4: You're welcome, Sydney, Australia.\nSpeaker 6: And guess what? How have we not done that? We would have lost sooner, because that would have over.\nSpeaker 2: Christopher is relying on nobody ever having played pandemic, because Sydney, Australia is actually next to nothing, and would not have saved anything. New York is like a hub to the world. I'm so embarrassed for him, because really, if you have any of you understand what we're talking about, and you will see what a hot mess he is in this discussion.\nSpeaker 1: Moving on to early America and the train system in...\nSpeaker 3: Take it to red.\nSpeaker 2: So now we're playing Take It to Red, and I'm just going to predict it right now that I'll win. Throwing that out there. How about that?\nSpeaker 3: You can put the internet in the play or hands, because it's your trip. Harry keeps wanting me to do my trip. You guys, this is really stressful. Our board is filling up, folks. Look at those trains.\nSpeaker 6: Look at those trains. Oh, yes.\nSpeaker 8: Oh, yes.\nSpeaker 9: Foodie, you think the fun ones are at this party?\nSpeaker 2: We need your boat down below. We'll pin the winner. Very, very tall. Oh, hello, Seattle. I forgot the rules, and so I didn't play my best abilities.\nSpeaker 1: I played to my best abilities. I'm playing with my...\nSpeaker 2: Because you want to remember the rules. So we'll see who wins, and I'm just saying, I don't know. Guess who won, guys.\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead and guess.\nSpeaker 3: I'm going to be some time.\nSpeaker 2: Who's free you want to talk to everybody?\nSpeaker 6: Well, I'm over here at 74, which was really sad, because I was slated to go much further, because I was slated to go much further, but I didn't make it to one of my cities, so... Right, show.\nSpeaker 9: When it was a big card, it was like a 20-something card.\nSpeaker 6: What are we talking about our total number? 105.\nSpeaker 9: 108.\nSpeaker 8: I had 132.\nSpeaker 2: I'm just saying, I can't figure out who won there or not, but I don't know. Maybe you guys want to answer that. Yeah, I didn't know we're changing. I will be back here next week with an actual strategy. Oh, rematch! The way to get a ratio back here is to be a jerk about winning.\nSpeaker 4: Is that how?\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, so be it.\nSpeaker 2: You fail to understand the competitive nature. I guess this is what sports is. I've been too nice to you.\nSpeaker 4: That's what it is.\nSpeaker 2: Now that I think about it, I thought the real Rachel was you wouldn't play any games with me when I was...\nSpeaker 3: No, kind of. Don't make me feel stupid, I don't want to play with you.\nSpeaker 2: Then you can feel stupid.\nSpeaker 3: Not at all.\nSpeaker 2: Just now, you're just being overly cocky about your abilities, but not diminishing minds.\nSpeaker 9: Therefore, competitive.\nSpeaker 2: I don't even know who won yet. I was so waiting for people to do the math. I know we were just going to tell you, Jess.\nSpeaker 3: Nobody's going to tell you.\nSpeaker 2: You've got to do the math on your own. I don't know, I can't figure out. I have to do it on calculations. I know, as I'm not the one cleaning out.\nSpeaker 3: Oh, my God!\nSpeaker 6: Don't worry. We've left all your red pieces out there.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, man, that's a lot of pieces though.\nSpeaker 6: Oh, man, that's a lot of pieces though. It's like a lot of pieces. A lot of successful, trained pieces on that board.\nSpeaker 6: Hi.\nSpeaker 4: Let's talk about what we learned today. We learned that you should never visit somebody's house empty handed.\nSpeaker 6: Always pack a lunch.\nSpeaker 4: We learned that Parker expresses his joy of a new killed by screaming loud enough for all of Scotland to hear him. And finally, we learned that if you want Rachel to come over more often,\nSpeaker 2: it's just got to be mean to her. Thanks for watching, everybody.

Transcript: Speaker 1: I got you boys! KILT from Scotland!\nSpeaker 2: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nSpeaker 2: Good morning everyone! Hello! Hello! Hi! What's on your ears? Are those beautiful ears? Yeah!\nSpeaker 3: I have a baby!\nSpeaker 1: What's your ears? Are those really? Yeah, really! Oh my goodness! I just got my ears pierced! Oh my goodness! I just got my ears pierced! Oh my goodness!\nSpeaker 2: I just got my ears pierced! Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness!\nSpeaker 1: That's my first one in your first stone!\nSpeaker 2: Oh my gosh, you look beautiful! What's this? Our lunch! That looks fairly surprising Colleen with her new earrings! The bad news is, I bought two presents for you guys in Europe and one got lost in the luggage. So one of them is still in Europe somewhere. And I'm going to tell you what it is. So when I was in Amsterdam, it was a really cool city.\nSpeaker 2: It's like my favorite city. Your mommy and daddy went there on their honeymoon.\nSpeaker 1: I found a store that had weird, cool, crazy looking fidget spinners. And I bought you each one. Oh my gosh! But they're still in whales. So those will get shipped here. They probably won't come for like a month or something. But the good news is that when you get them, you will have forgotten about them. So it'll be like a surprise. But I did have something else for you. But no, the bottom's coming too. Okay. Oh, here it comes.\nSpeaker 4: It's a bunch of different places.\nSpeaker 2: I went to Amsterdam.\nSpeaker 1: I went to Scotland. I went to Wales.\nSpeaker 2: I went to Sweden. I went all over the place. So I got you guys stuff in different places.\nSpeaker 4: But I got this for Dunky. It's a little Scottish dog.\nSpeaker 1: It's a little Scottish dog. I think I've been having fun. Love stuffed animals. Love stuffed animals. And I got that doggy because it has the same material as something I got for the boys.\nSpeaker 2: So do you know what they wear in Scotland? The boys?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Why they wear in Scotland? They wear kilts. And so I got you boys. Kilts from Scotland! ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I was waiting for a kilt!\nSpeaker 2: They're back in the kilt.\nSpeaker 1: And they didn't have that piece of it. It's like you didn't like that. It's screaming very much. So it's like, you know what? It's like that screaming very much. It's like that screaming very much. It's like, you got the matching doggy print. So I don't know if they're going to fit you. They look really small to me. But here, let's make sure this fits here. Now as far as I know, kilts they represent families in Scotland. So people would wear them to represent their clan. I watch Outlander lots.\nSpeaker 2: I feel like I know things about Scotland.\nSpeaker 1: But I'm sure I have a lot to learn.\nSpeaker 2: And I would love to share the history of kilts with the children. If you happen to know it and feel like sharing it with us.\nSpeaker 1: Wow, Jacob, you look amazing. Parker, oh my goodness. This is what I've been waiting for. It's awesome on you. It's awesome on you.\nSpeaker 3: It's awesome on you. It's awesome on you. Yeah, so these, I think these go down here.\nSpeaker 2: So it doesn't fly open. Parker's been wanting a kilt for years. Like he's been wanting one for a very long time. And whenever I find them online, they're like hundreds of dollars. So, yeah. I think in Scotland, and they were much more reasonably priced. Oh, I have something else, Parker. That might complete the outfit if you want it.\nSpeaker 1: That might complete the outfit if you want it. If you don't want this, this is okay. So I bought something when I was in Scotland. Because my hair was really curly and big. And I needed something to put down. Because the wind was blowing into my face. So I got a traditional Scottish hat.\nSpeaker 2: That looks awesome.\nSpeaker 1: I'll show Mommy. So it's so cool. One cool thing about Edinburgh, which is my favorite city. Like, probably in the world. It's in the middle of the city. It's a huge castle. Like a huge, beautiful castle. At the top of the city. So we went there. And what we got to see, which I've never seen before in my whole life, was the real crown that the princess and the queen wear from like, for hundreds and hundreds of years. We saw the actual... Yeah, Mary Queen of Scots, like actual crown and scepter. And so I bought you a princess crown at the castle. With diamonds all over it. With beautiful. Isn't that pretty? Isn't that beautiful? So that's a real crown from Scotland. That's beautiful. It matches perfect. Oh, wow. And you guys have fidget spinners coming soon too.\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. Love you guys.\nSpeaker 1: Love you. I tried to get a kilt for a donkey too, but they didn't have them in his size. But you know, it's cool parkers when you go out of this one, and it seems like it's going to be soon. Maybe Jake will share his with you too, because it's the next size up. And you can do it. You are stuck again. We are home from Queens now. Most of the kids are having bad, except for this guy.\nSpeaker 2: We're going to do that or going to Seoul.\nSpeaker 1: He's our superstar of the week, and earned a bunch of good credits from good behavior. And so he gets to stay up an hour later than the other kids. Go Jacob, proud of you buddy.\nSpeaker 3: And what a night to get to stay up late, is we have Kazan Andrew.\nSpeaker 2: And then this guy, deep in thought, and we have our dear Rachel here. Moscow, gone heat.\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what's going on. So. And me.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm still Rachel. It's funny you should say you don't know what's going on, Rachel, because clearly we are playing the epic game of pandemic.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, so we're about to save the world.\nSpeaker 2: I'm really sorry, world. It didn't end well for you. Because of this guy.\nSpeaker 6: Because of you guys were on your phones all the time.\nSpeaker 3: You didn't even look at the time.\nSpeaker 2: Excuse us.\nSpeaker 3: We came up with a better strategy, and they didn't go with it, and that's why the world was so great. I was like, say New York, say New York, and they're like, whatever. You did hear us say it, Andrew. Because we moved your piece to right nice in New York. And then Christopher was like, did you see New York and go save Africa? And we were like, what? I have no idea.\nSpeaker 1: No.\nSpeaker 6: We saved Sydney, Australia.\nSpeaker 4: You're welcome, Sydney, Australia.\nSpeaker 6: And guess what? How have we not done that? We would have lost sooner, because that would have over.\nSpeaker 2: Christopher is relying on nobody ever having played pandemic, because Sydney, Australia is actually next to nothing, and would not have saved anything. New York is like a hub to the world. I'm so embarrassed for him, because really, if you have any of you understand what we're talking about, and you will see what a hot mess he is in this discussion.\nSpeaker 1: Moving on to early America and the train system in...\nSpeaker 3: Take it to red.\nSpeaker 2: So now we're playing Take It to Red, and I'm just going to predict it right now that I'll win. Throwing that out there. How about that?\nSpeaker 3: You can put the internet in the play or hands, because it's your trip. Harry keeps wanting me to do my trip. You guys, this is really stressful. Our board is filling up, folks. Look at those trains.\nSpeaker 6: Look at those trains. Oh, yes.\nSpeaker 8: Oh, yes.\nSpeaker 9: Foodie, you think the fun ones are at this party?\nSpeaker 2: We need your boat down below. We'll pin the winner. Very, very tall. Oh, hello, Seattle. I forgot the rules, and so I didn't play my best abilities.\nSpeaker 1: I played to my best abilities. I'm playing with my...\nSpeaker 2: Because you want to remember the rules. So we'll see who wins, and I'm just saying, I don't know. Guess who won, guys.\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead and guess.\nSpeaker 3: I'm going to be some time.\nSpeaker 2: Who's free you want to talk to everybody?\nSpeaker 6: Well, I'm over here at 74, which was really sad, because I was slated to go much further, because I was slated to go much further, but I didn't make it to one of my cities, so... Right, show.\nSpeaker 9: When it was a big card, it was like a 20-something card.\nSpeaker 6: What are we talking about our total number? 105.\nSpeaker 9: 108.\nSpeaker 8: I had 132.\nSpeaker 2: I'm just saying, I can't figure out who won there or not, but I don't know. Maybe you guys want to answer that. Yeah, I didn't know we're changing. I will be back here next week with an actual strategy. Oh, rematch! The way to get a ratio back here is to be a jerk about winning.\nSpeaker 4: Is that how?\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, so be it.\nSpeaker 2: You fail to understand the competitive nature. I guess this is what sports is. I've been too nice to you.\nSpeaker 4: That's what it is.\nSpeaker 2: Now that I think about it, I thought the real Rachel was you wouldn't play any games with me when I was...\nSpeaker 3: No, kind of. Don't make me feel stupid, I don't want to play with you.\nSpeaker 2: Then you can feel stupid.\nSpeaker 3: Not at all.\nSpeaker 2: Just now, you're just being overly cocky about your abilities, but not diminishing minds.\nSpeaker 9: Therefore, competitive.\nSpeaker 2: I don't even know who won yet. I was so waiting for people to do the math. I know we were just going to tell you, Jess.\nSpeaker 3: Nobody's going to tell you.\nSpeaker 2: You've got to do the math on your own. I don't know, I can't figure out. I have to do it on calculations. I know, as I'm not the one cleaning out.\nSpeaker 3: Oh, my God!\nSpeaker 6: Don't worry. We've left all your red pieces out there.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, man, that's a lot of pieces though.\nSpeaker 6: Oh, man, that's a lot of pieces though. It's like a lot of pieces. A lot of successful, trained pieces on that board.\nSpeaker 6: Hi.\nSpeaker 4: Let's talk about what we learned today. We learned that you should never visit somebody's house empty handed.\nSpeaker 6: Always pack a lunch.\nSpeaker 4: We learned that Parker expresses his joy of a new killed by screaming loud enough for all of Scotland to hear him. And finally, we learned that if you want Rachel to come over more often,\nSpeaker 2: it's just got to be mean to her. Thanks for watching, everybody. See you next time.. **End of transcript** Combine images and transcript, answer this question: What makes s1's comment about Parker's reaction humorous?.

Wait, hold on, wait a second. Because I'm white in almost every way.\nSpeaker 1: What do you mean white on paper? That's beyond me.\nSpeaker 2: Well, like, seven years ago, the census had came around, right? Sure. And the census came and they showed up to my house. And they asked me what my nationality was, because they was counting to see how many black people in a neighborhood. And I was like, um, what do you mean? I'm American. And he was like, no, what's your race? And I was like, oh, so if we're doing that today, we bring a racism right to my front. And I was like, ooh. This is my chance. And I had like a that's so raving moment. And I had like a that's so raving moment. I went into my brain and it was like a whole conversation. Like, girl, this is your chance. What do you mean this is my chance? Or, I'ma say this time for change. You could be whatever you want to be today. And I was like, you right. I can't be whatever I'm on to be. And I looked at him and I said, I'm Caucasian. Because I know I got a car and I know a lot of Asians. Because I know I got a car and I know a lot of Asians. So I just put that together. And I told him, I was a white woman. And I was like, I'm a white woman. And I was like, I'm a white woman. And I was like, I'm a white woman. And I told him, I was Caucasian. And he said, OK, he checked the white box. And it has been fantastic. Well, what? OK, when he checked the box on the census thing,\nSpeaker 1: how has it affected your life? Oh, my goodness.\nSpeaker 2: Like a few days later, my credit score went up about 300 points. I got a black card. I got a Mexican housekeeper now. Life has been really awesome. I've been booking all these TV show roles because of affirmative action. They need white women to play black women. So that's me. Congratulations. Yeah. Now, many comedians have to struggle. They talk about the struggle. They have when they're starting off,\nSpeaker 1: you have an extraordinary level of struggle. You, I understand, how long ago were you doing gigs homeless?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was living in my Geo Metro, two door hatchback killing again. But I was homeless. How long was it talking? I was homeless. This was 2004, 2003. And I was very homeless. And I was a type of chick that like, I didn't want anybody, like I'm very prideful. And so I didn't want anybody to know. I was homeless. I kept my nails done, kept my hair done. And I would have like all my suitcases and stuff in the car. And I'd be driving around. And I'd cover them up with blankets. And this one day, I drove in front of the comedy club. I was at the Lafactory and crev'in heart was there. And he was like, yo, Tim, what's up with all this stuff in your car? You live out of there or something? And I was like, look, I'm in between houses right now. Don't bother me. Like, you hear me alone. He was like, where are you sleeping at? I was like, in Beverly Hills. And he was like, what? I was like, yeah, I parked on the street in Beverly Hills. And he was like, you sleeping in your car? Like, you a beautiful woman. You could be with any man. Like, you could just be with a man. And I was like, look, I sleep with people to heal them. Not for roof, something in my head. And... The dish is no longer. All right. Okay. Because I got magical powers.\nSpeaker 1: This is where life comes from in Hills.\nSpeaker 2: And so... So he had a long conversation with me.\nSpeaker 1: He had a long conversation with me.

Make a list of goals of what you want from your life. What do you want for your life? Make a list. And when you sitting in that room, start figuring out how to tackle that list.

They intersect. One called Tiffany and one called Haddish. And then I start like, you've centers over there. And like, people be like, where you learn how to do that? I learn that on Tiffany and Haddish. That's beautiful. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Well, congratulations.\nSpeaker 2: I just... What a joy just to sit next to you.

It would degree to your like them. They compared to another five, then you give it 20 more. And then 30, then it get down to 10. And at the end of that, about 30 minutes of this, they'll give you five films that you'd love. And I loved every one of them. Really? They sold that to Herod's.

What do they win?\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's mostly a bragging rights type of thing. We do have some pretty cool trophies. We've got some mugs and some other things to go to the riders. But really what this is about is a training exercise and opportunity for our motorcycle cops. We train very, very hard before we ever get on a motorcycle and start working the street. And to keep those skills sharp, we have to ride. And we have to ride cone patterns like this to keep our skills up. This is what's going to save us when we're out there working. Evasive maneuvers, collision avoidance, those kinds of things.\nSpeaker 3: And it's a heck of a lot of fun for us too. So we spend a fair amount of time putting these events together.

And how often do you have these training exercises?\nSpeaker 2: We have exercises like this. And this is coupled with our annual traffic safety fair. This is our fifth annual event. We've done this thing every summer, usually when it's really, really hot, unfortunately. But today, hopefully, the climate will be a little bit cooperative.\nSpeaker 3: We do something like this once a year. Fairfield are partners at Fairfield PD have one every year. The Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department has one in Lafayette. There are competitions that we go to in Nevada, Carson City, Sheriff's Office has one. San Francisco PD has had one before. So it's something that there's kind of the traveling road show. All of these guys are a lot of them that ride that you might see today, ride together, and we've been riding together for many years, competing against one another.\nSpeaker 1: To watch you guys compete in this. What's it like for you to be able to interact with the public in a different way?\nSpeaker 2: It's a lot of fun. And with all of the family-oriented stuff that we have going on with the bounce houses and the other stuff, we've got a bicycle rodeo for the little ones, that all of that stuff brings people out, gets us to interact with the community on a level that is, like you said, it is different than what we normally do. So when we have an opportunity to do that, we really enjoy it. The public enjoys it. And they get to see us having a little bit of fun. A little bit of a lighter note.\nSpeaker 3: We're not competitive. We're absolutely competitive with one another. So when we do stuff like that, they're going to see it. But the other side of it is, if, hey, somebody needs a hand, we're right there to help each other out, because that's the way it goes. What a fun experience. And what time can people come out there to see you?\nSpeaker 2: Our opening ceremonies are going to kick off here at about 8:30. The first motorcycle will go in at 9 o'clock. We will run throughout the day. Some of the things to be aware of, the speed course, as we call it, which is one rider in at a time. Their penalties are for cones down or for putting their foot down or something like that. Those will go from about 9 until 11 o'clock. We'll take a little bit of a break at lunchtime. We're going to have what we call the last man standing event, which is dramatic. That's a lot of fun. Essentially, what we do is kind of clear some of the cones out of the middle. And we run all of the motorcycles in at the same time. Essentially, we're trying to get each other to penalize. We're trying to get people to put a foot down. So you'll see guys cutting each other off. You'll see guys trying to run each other into cones. There's no intentional ramming. It's not an aggressive thing, but it's a tactical thing. That'll be at around noon. We'll get started with round two of the speed event after lunch. And then at the end of the afternoon, we'll have a team event where two riders will be in at the patterns at the same time following each other through. And it's a coordinated effort. So there's a lot of stuff to see.\nSpeaker 1: Officer Bali, thank you so much for joining us this morning. Good luck to you if you're competing.\nSpeaker 2: I am competing. I'll be right on number four.\nSpeaker 3: OK, we're rooting you on.\nSpeaker 1: Go number four. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day.\nSpeaker 3: You too.. **End of transcript** Combine images and transcript, answer this question: How does S2 feel about the annual motorcycle training event?.

Transcript: Speaker 1: I mean, I said, I'm, do you guys watch the debate on CNBC last night? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm so sorry. Now, I did watch it. And in some ways, it was impressive. It managed to thread the needle between confusing and boring. But if I'm going to talk about the debate, it's now or never. Though, never is attempting option. OK, and I blame the moderators. Because it started on the very first question.\nSpeaker 2: This first is an open question. This series of debates is essentially a job interview with the American people. And in any job interview, you know this. n  And in any job interview, you know this. You get asked, what's your biggest weakness? So in 30 seconds, what is your biggest weakness and what are you doing to address it?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, they open with the one question that no one in human history has ever answered honestly. In fact, when I interviewed, when I interviewed for this job, I said my biggest weakness was sometimes I work so hard, I forget to cash my paychecks. But if all the non-answers, the candidates then gave, Ted Cruz's was the most least.\nSpeaker 3: If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done.\nSpeaker 1: That's a great appeal to the voters.\nSpeaker 1: Ted Cruz 2016, getting the car. And after the first question, CNBC showed us how to conduct a debate unburdened by a shred of respect.\nSpeaker 4: Senator Rubio, you're skipping more votes than any senator to run for president?\nSpeaker 1: Governor Bush, the fact that you're at the fifth lecture tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race, Mr. Trump. Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign? I'm not a historian.\nSpeaker 2: Your board fired you. I just wondered why you think we should hire you now. Wow.\nSpeaker 1: That is the most disrespectful question since the Lincoln Douglas debate started with, Mr. Lincoln, douchebags says what? And what the moderators lacked in courtesy they made up for in lack of preparation.\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Trump, let's stay on this issue of immigration. You have been very critical of Mark Zuckerberg, a Facebook who has wanted to increase the number of these H1B. I was not at all critical of him.\nSpeaker 1: Where did I read this and come up with this that you were?\nSpeaker 3: Probably, I don't know. You people write this stuff. I don't know what you're saying.\nSpeaker 2: To be fair, that was just journalism 101. Who, when, where, why, and what the hell am I talking about? But I got a hand at the Republicans. They stood their ground and they put up a fight.\nSpeaker 4: The questions that have been asked so far in this debate, illustrate why the American people don't trust the media. Donald Trump, are you a comic book villain? Ben Carson, can you do math?\nSpeaker 1: Donald Trump, are you a comic book villain? Ben Carson, can you do math? Such a nasty question. It's not a very nicely-as-question the way you say that.\nSpeaker 2: John? John, do you want me to answer you one answer? Because I got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called room.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Listen to the governor of New Jersey.\nSpeaker 1: He knows the people in his home state act like animals. Closing statements in Newark get chopped up and dumped in the metallands. So there you have it. Much like the campaign season itself last night felt like an unending slog. And believe it or not, it could have been even unendinger. If it wasn't for the heroic action taken by the night in shining bronzer. Jim? These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three three and a half hours. I went out and said, it's ridiculous. Nobody, I could stand up here all night. Nobody wants to watch three and a half or three hours.\nSpeaker 10: We called in, we said, that's it, we're not doing it.\nSpeaker 1: And at about two minutes, I renegotiated it down to two hours so we can get the hell out of here. Not bad. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Trump 2016. Donald, you saved us from another hour and a half of that debate. You truly are a great leader and you have earned my vote as long as you can negotiate your presidency down from four years to, you know, two hours feels about rights. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! But it's no surprise things didn't go that smoothly because even for the debate started, the campaigns were complaining to the Republican National Committee about their green rooms. Marco Rubio's green room had a movie theater in it. Donald Trump's green room had some couches and flat screen TVs. On the left is Carly Fearena's green room. It has a Jacuzzi in it. On the right is Rand Paul's green room that looks like a jail cell. Rand Paul and Chris Christie are basically getting a closet with a toilet in it. Marco Rubio's green room had a movie theater in it. Donald Trump's green room had some couches and flat screen TVs. On the left is Carly Fearena's green room. It has a Jacuzzi in it. On the right is Rand Paul's green room that looks like a jail cell. Rand Paul and Chris Christie are basically getting a closet with a toilet in it. I toilet in a closet. Well, maybe it wasn't an insult. For instance, the RNC might have just wanted Chris Christie to be closer to where his campaign has gone. And... And I understand the candidates were upset, but as someone who has a lot of guests on his show, I know sometimes it's hard to find equal space. Usually your first guest gets the nicest room closest to the stage over here. Sometimes you need to reserve your biggest room for the band. And sometimes guests like authors who are great end up in our more humble accommodations. For instance, last night we had National Book Award winner Jonathan Franzon and his great. When I stopped by to say hi to him before our show, I found out he'd been put in one of our smaller dressing rooms.\nSpeaker 5: Hey, Megan.\nSpeaker 2: Hey, what dressing room is Jonathan Franzon in?\nSpeaker 5: Um, there'll be 11.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, great. Mr. Franzon, we're almost ready for you. Thank you. Be right out. Great. Hey, did you get the flowers that I sent you? No, I didn't see them. They should be over by the makeup mirror. Oh, yeah. Beautiful. I'll be right out. Just finishing a cigarette here.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Franzon, we're almost ready for you. Thank you. Be right out. Great. Hey, did you get the flowers that I sent you? No, I didn't see them. They should be over by the makeup mirror. Oh, yeah. Beautiful. I'll be right out. Just finishing a cigarette here. Okay, I'll see you on stage. Though actually Jonathan, you really shouldn't be smoking in there. Jesus, I set the curtains on fire. Help! Oh my God. Jonathan, are you okay? I'll be right back. Help me. Help me. Help. Jesus, I set the curtains on fire. Help! Oh my God. Jonathan, are you okay? I'll be right back. Help me. Help me. Help. Hello, help. Jonathan, back away from the door. Get in the corner of your dressing room. I'm going to try to chop you out. That was a close one. That was a... That was a close one. But Mr. Franzon is fine. We got him out of his dressing room and we're able to rush him over to our hospital.. **End of transcript** Combine images and transcript, answer this question: How do you think s1 feels about the CNBC debate moderators?.

Transcript: Speaker 1: I mean, I said, I'm, do you guys watch the debate on CNBC last night? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm so sorry. Now, I did watch it. And in some ways, it was impressive. It managed to thread the needle between confusing and boring. But if I'm going to talk about the debate, it's now or never. Though, never is attempting option. OK, and I blame the moderators. Because it started on the very first question.\nSpeaker 2: This first is an open question. This series of debates is essentially a job interview with the American people. And in any job interview, you know this. n  And in any job interview, you know this. You get asked, what's your biggest weakness? So in 30 seconds, what is your biggest weakness and what are you doing to address it?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, they open with the one question that no one in human history has ever answered honestly. In fact, when I interviewed, when I interviewed for this job, I said my biggest weakness was sometimes I work so hard, I forget to cash my paychecks. But if all the non-answers, the candidates then gave, Ted Cruz's was the most least.\nSpeaker 3: If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done.\nSpeaker 1: That's a great appeal to the voters.\nSpeaker 1: Ted Cruz 2016, getting the car. And after the first question, CNBC showed us how to conduct a debate unburdened by a shred of respect.\nSpeaker 4: Senator Rubio, you're skipping more votes than any senator to run for president?\nSpeaker 1: Governor Bush, the fact that you're at the fifth lecture tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race, Mr. Trump. Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign? I'm not a historian.\nSpeaker 2: Your board fired you. I just wondered why you think we should hire you now. Wow.\nSpeaker 1: That is the most disrespectful question since the Lincoln Douglas debate started with, Mr. Lincoln, douchebags says what? And what the moderators lacked in courtesy they made up for in lack of preparation.\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Trump, let's stay on this issue of immigration. You have been very critical of Mark Zuckerberg, a Facebook who has wanted to increase the number of these H1B. I was not at all critical of him.\nSpeaker 1: Where did I read this and come up with this that you were?\nSpeaker 3: Probably, I don't know. You people write this stuff. I don't know what you're saying.\nSpeaker 2: To be fair, that was just journalism 101. Who, when, where, why, and what the hell am I talking about? But I got a hand at the Republicans. They stood their ground and they put up a fight.\nSpeaker 4: The questions that have been asked so far in this debate, illustrate why the American people don't trust the media. Donald Trump, are you a comic book villain? Ben Carson, can you do math?\nSpeaker 1: Donald Trump, are you a comic book villain? Ben Carson, can you do math? Such a nasty question. It's not a very nicely-as-question the way you say that.\nSpeaker 2: John? John, do you want me to answer you one answer? Because I got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called room.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Listen to the governor of New Jersey.\nSpeaker 1: He knows the people in his home state act like animals. Closing statements in Newark get chopped up and dumped in the metallands. So there you have it. Much like the campaign season itself last night felt like an unending slog. And believe it or not, it could have been even unendinger. If it wasn't for the heroic action taken by the night in shining bronzer. Jim? These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three three and a half hours. I went out and said, it's ridiculous. Nobody, I could stand up here all night. Nobody wants to watch three and a half or three hours.\nSpeaker 10: We called in, we said, that's it, we're not doing it.\nSpeaker 1: And at about two minutes, I renegotiated it down to two hours so we can get the hell out of here. Not bad. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Trump 2016. Donald, you saved us from another hour and a half of that debate. You truly are a great leader and you have earned my vote as long as you can negotiate your presidency down from four years to, you know, two hours feels about rights. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! But it's no surprise things didn't go that smoothly because even for the debate started, the campaigns were complaining to the Republican National Committee about their green rooms. Marco Rubio's green room had a movie theater in it. Donald Trump's green room had some couches and flat screen TVs. On the left is Carly Fearena's green room. It has a Jacuzzi in it. On the right is Rand Paul's green room that looks like a jail cell. Rand Paul and Chris Christie are basically getting a closet with a toilet in it. Marco Rubio's green room had a movie theater in it. Donald Trump's green room had some couches and flat screen TVs. On the left is Carly Fearena's green room. It has a Jacuzzi in it. On the right is Rand Paul's green room that looks like a jail cell. Rand Paul and Chris Christie are basically getting a closet with a toilet in it. I toilet in a closet. Well, maybe it wasn't an insult. For instance, the RNC might have just wanted Chris Christie to be closer to where his campaign has gone. And... And I understand the candidates were upset, but as someone who has a lot of guests on his show, I know sometimes it's hard to find equal space. Usually your first guest gets the nicest room closest to the stage over here. Sometimes you need to reserve your biggest room for the band. And sometimes guests like authors who are great end up in our more humble accommodations. For instance, last night we had National Book Award winner Jonathan Franzon and his great. When I stopped by to say hi to him before our show, I found out he'd been put in one of our smaller dressing rooms.\nSpeaker 5: Hey, Megan.\nSpeaker 2: Hey, what dressing room is Jonathan Franzon in?\nSpeaker 5: Um, there'll be 11.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, great. Mr. Franzon, we're almost ready for you. Thank you. Be right out. Great. Hey, did you get the flowers that I sent you? No, I didn't see them. They should be over by the makeup mirror. Oh, yeah. Beautiful. I'll be right out. Just finishing a cigarette here.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Franzon, we're almost ready for you. Thank you. Be right out. Great. Hey, did you get the flowers that I sent you? No, I didn't see them. They should be over by the makeup mirror. Oh, yeah. Beautiful. I'll be right out. Just finishing a cigarette here. Okay, I'll see you on stage. Though actually Jonathan, you really shouldn't be smoking in there. Jesus, I set the curtains on fire. Help! Oh my God. Jonathan, are you okay? I'll be right back. Help me. Help me. Help. Jesus, I set the curtains on fire. Help! Oh my God. Jonathan, are you okay? I'll be right back. Help me. Help me. Help. Hello, help. Jonathan, back away from the door. Get in the corner of your dressing room. I'm going to try to chop you out. That was a close one. That was a... That was a close one. But Mr. Franzon is fine. We got him out of his dressing room and we're able to rush him over to our hospital.. **End of transcript** Combine images and transcript, answer this question: What is the nature of the relationship between S1 and S2 based on their discussion?.

We wouldn't ask if it wasn't urgent, honey.\nSpeaker 2: How much?\nSpeaker 1: About a million.\nSpeaker 2: A million dollars.\nSpeaker 3: A little under.\nSpeaker 2: Under. What if Uncle Jim's land is worth that much than yours is, too?\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't know. I've never had it appraised. My father taught me you never sell land.\nSpeaker 3: Good advice.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Grandma Smith's dad when I was 11. Have you been sitting on a million dollars since I was 11?\nSpeaker 3: No, no. We'd appreciate it over time. It escalates.\nSpeaker 2: You knew about this? Do you realize what we could have done with that money?\nSpeaker 3: I don't want my kids raising a goddamn hand out.\nSpeaker 2: What the hell? What the hell is wrong with you?\nSpeaker 3: Nice rose.\nSpeaker 3: Hey, Mal.\nSpeaker 2: Don't ever call me that again.\nSpeaker 3: Come on. You're upset. But let's just go back and talk about this.\nSpeaker 2: Dad, why do you think all of us ran away from you? We were drowning. I still don't understand why you followed us here.\nSpeaker 1: We wanted to be a family again.\nSpeaker 2: We were never a family, Mom. We were a nightmare.\nSpeaker 3: Your mom and I did everything we could for you, okay? We looked after you and you were a happy family.\nSpeaker 2: Bullshit! We did it. We took care of each other because you were too drunk to. It was your job to protect us and you didn't even try.\nSpeaker 3: That ain't true, okay? You got some kind of weird revisionist history going on. You were a happy kid.\nSpeaker 2: Stop it.\nSpeaker 3: And then you were happy kids.\nSpeaker 2: Stop talking! Talking is not trying. You talked my whole goddamn life. I believed you.\nSpeaker 3: Hey, don't do this.\nSpeaker 2: I don't want you in my life.\nSpeaker 3: Jeanette,\nSpeaker 2: I don't want you to call or write or show up out of the blue. I don't want another one of your bullshit stories. I don't want to see you anymore.. **End of transcript** Combine images and transcript, answer this question: Is it socially acceptable for s1 to ask s2 for a large sum of money under these circumstances?.

No. She believes anything I tell her. No, I would have, and then she got all weepy about her dad or something. But tonight... I am sealing the deal.
